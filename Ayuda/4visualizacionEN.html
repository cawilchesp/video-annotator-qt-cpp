		<h2><a name="visualizacion">4. VIDEO DISPLAY</a></h2>
			<p>
				To start, choose the video you want to ANALYZE, in <b>File &rarr; Open</b>. When the video is loaded, playback and frame selection controls will be activated, and the video information will be presented, as illustrated in <a href="#figura2">Figure 2</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The application has a playback bar at the bottom (see <a href="#figura2">Figure 2</a>), composed of controls for playback (numbers from 1 to 7), a slider bar to go through the video (number 8) and a text box (number 9) for the selection of a desired frame.
			</p>

				<p>Figure 2. Video display.</p>
			</center>
			<p>
				The functions of each bar control are described below:
				<ol>
					<li>Reduce playback speed.</li>
					<li>Reverse 1 frame.</li>
					<li>Reverse playback.</li>
					<li>Pause.</li>
					<li>Playback.</li>
					<li>Advance 1 frame.</li>
					<li>Increase playback speed.</li>
					<li>Slider to go through the video.</li>
					<li>Text box for the selection of a frame (press enter).</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Video playback, normal or reverse, will continue until the user pauses the video or the end is reached. During playback, the slider and text box present the frame number in which the video is located. The playback speed can be increased or decreased between 1x (normal speed) to 10x.
			</p>
			<p>
				The slider allows to go through the video, regardless of whether the video is paused or playing. For the precise selection of a video frame using the text box, it is necessary that the video is paused. If a frame number is written outside of the video range, the user will be informed that he must select another frame number and be informed of the permitted range for the video (see <a href="#figura3"> Figure 3 </a>).
